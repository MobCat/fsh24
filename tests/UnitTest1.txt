In this test we are using the UnitTest1.py script to corrupt a 5gb test archive in a semi random way.
testfile-5GB.7z is our control. The fsh24 sum generated by this file is what all of our corrupted files are tested against.
The next 30 files have 2 numbers next to them
the first number is the percentage the file is corrupted.
the second number is a random sample amount, where the file was corrupted in this case 3 random different ways.

The last 10 files in this test aimed to check if a file failed to download completely.
And as we are keeping track of the file size in fsh24, this test is almost skipped over as fsh24 knows the files
are incomplete just based on file size.
The number in this test is at what point in percentage the file transfer has stopped.
Even at 99% complete the file size is still different enough to know something has gone wrong and to not even
bother with more in-depth tests. Might add a bypass flag to bypass the file size test and only do the checksum
but the whole point of fsh24 is to verified the file you have downloaded is complete, nothing more.
If the file size is off that's normally a good enough test. But if something got messed up in the download
but the file still managed to download completely then that's what the checksum is for.
